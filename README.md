When the user presses the microphone, the AI will listen into the conversation and take notes on what the conversation is about, what the people like, and what they dislike. Once it detects a 10 second silence, it will auto-generate some responses based on what they were last talking about, and it will have a re-generate button just in case the user doesn’t like the 3 options.
Motive for making this app? Many people hate the awkward silence when meeting new people or catching up with old friends. This app aims to eliminate that awkward silence and improve communication skills. It’s a problem everyone has, especially freshmen in college.
